üìä Big Data Analysis - Internship Task 2 | CODTECH

This repository contains my submission for Task-2 of the CODTECH Internship Program, focused on predictive analysis using machine learning.

üîç Task Overview:

In this task, I applied machine learning techniques to analyze border crossing data to make predictions about future trends or behaviors. The data I used likely includes information like the number of vehicles or pedestrians crossing a border, time of day, weather conditions, and other relevant factors that might affect border crossings.
