üìä Big Data Analysis - Internship Task 2 | CODTECH

This repository contains my submission for Task-2 of the CODTECH Internship Program, focused on predictive analysis using machine learning.

üîç Task Overview:

In this task, I applied machine learning techniques to analyze border crossing data to make predictions about future trends or behaviors. The data I used likely includes information like the number of vehicles or pedestrians crossing a border, time of day, weather conditions, and other relevant factors that might affect border crossings.

Understand patterns: By analyzing past data, you could uncover trends such as peak crossing times, the impact of holidays or weather on traffic, etc.

Build a model: You used machine learning algorithms (like decision trees, regression, or others) to build a model that can predict future border crossings based on the historical data you provided.

Make predictions: Once your model was trained, you used it to forecast future border crossing events. For example, predicting the number of cars crossing the border at a specific time or predicting delays based on certain conditions.
